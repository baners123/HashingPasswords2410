# HashingPasswords2410
Hashing Passwords Project done by Jimi Adegoroye, Josh W., and Steven Davis

1. Problem Statement:

The problem that our group will address is creating a password hashing system that not only resists these cyber attacks but also adapts to future advances in technology. Thus making passwords more secure. Password security is a critical aspect of modern digital systems but unfortunately does not stop many users from creating weak passwords. Furthermore, users frequently reuse personal information in their passwords, compounding security risks. This makes their accounts vulnerable to breaches. 

2. Proposed Solution: 

Hashing will determine whether a password meets the minimum requirement such as having an uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. The code will also ensure that the user doesnâ€™t use their name or personal information, reducing vulnerability and the chances of a cyber attack. To provide users with feedback, the system can show the strength level (Weak, Moderate, and Strong) based on the complexity of the passwords. Adding rate limiting and assessing the time it would take to brute force the password adds an extra layer of security, making it more challenging for attackers to compromise accounts.

3. Feasibility and Impact: 

The Feasibility of the project is dependent on the building block approach our team is taking to our password-hashing project. At its very basis is a password checking and storage system. But we will build upon this by adding more complex functions such as password feedback, ASCII strength variability, brute force protection, and password rarity feedback. We pan on the divide and conquer approach attacking the different attributes we want included.
